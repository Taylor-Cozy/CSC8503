# C++ Physics Engine
## University Coursework

This is part of my MSc in Games Engineering. I had to replicate the game screwball scramble by creating my own physics engine. The coursework was split into two parts,
Part A consisted of simple collision detection, such as AABB, Sphere, plane, and Ray. It also required some collision resolution, application of forces, 
and a simple state based logic. Part B required some more advanced collision detection such as the use of OBBs, constraints, advanced AI, and pathfinding.
